MIPSim : a simple MIPS simulator written as a school project.

License
-------

The source code is available under BSD license. However, due to the dependency
on other libraries (most notably GNU readline), executables are licensed under
the terms of the GPL.


Build instructions
------------------

You need a C compiler to build MIPSim, preferably GCC but any C99 conformant
compiler should do.

Instead of a handwritten Makefile, a qmake project file is provided.

Build is as simple as :

$ qmake && make


Usage
-----

simips [options] program

Options :
  -t addr    : specify base address of text section (to load relocatable binaries)
  -d addr    : specify base address of data section (to load relocatable binaries)
  --debug    : enable debug output
  --version  : 


Documentation
-------------

You can obtain API docs using Doxygen

$ doxygen


Limitations
-----------

MIPSim can only run valid ELF32 binaries targeted to the MIPS I-IV architecture.

Such binaries can be obtained via a cross-compiler toolchain (e.g GCC build for
mips-elf target)

MIPSim does not emulate a MIPS pipeline and is not particularly accurate in terms
of instruction / memory timings : it just goes through the opcodes as fast as it
can without any effort to "harmonize" the time spent on each opcode...
