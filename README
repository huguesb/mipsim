MIPSim : a simple MIPS simulator written as a school project.


Build instructions
------------------

You need a C compiler to build MIPSim, preferably GCC but any C99 conformant
compiler should do.

Instead of a handwritten Makefile, a qmake project file is provided.

Build is as simple as :

$ qmake && make


Usage
-----

mipsim [-options] program

Options :
  -f freq    :
  -d         :
  -c file    : 


Limitations
-----------

MIPSim can only run valid ELF32 binaries targeted to the MIPS I-IV architecture.

Such binaries can be obtained via a cross-compiler toolchain (e.g GCC build for
mips-elf target)

MIPSim is not very accurate in terms of execution speed and memory timings.
