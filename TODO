 * Coprocessor support
    - model somewhat accurately control regs of cp1 (and cp0 ???)
    - exception handling
    - FPU
 * 64 bit support
    - address translation fix
    - 64 bit ALU
 * MIPS 32/64 R2 ISA
    - instructions decode
 * Better monitor / IO decoupling
 * debugger
    - watchpoints
    - read debugging informations from ELF sections?
 * automated tester
    - proper parsing of CLI arguments
    - more tweaking via CLI
    - make it manage properly target I/O
 * tests
    - some assembly code (teachers probably expect that...)
    - more complex C code


Priorities :
    * more tests, more complex tests
    * automated tester : I/O redirection

Goodies :
    * sort memory mappings by priority to improve simulator speed

Extras:
    * proper exceptions
    * watchpoints
    * FPU
